# Neighborhood Map
This JS app is based on Google Maps API and shows user nearby places for a pre-selected point.
## Run
To run the app open an `index.html` in your browser with enabled JS.
## Usage
Type your starting position in a search field in a top left corner of the map and hit search button. Your starting position and nearby places (500m radius) will be shown at the map. Click to the 'hamburger' button will open a list of nearby location with a filter feature. You can click on one of the markers on the map or one of the items in the list to see links from Wikipedia for this place.
